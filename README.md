A simple SMS gateway based off @erayedin Github Gist Code -https://gist.github.com/erayerdin
You can find the tutorial used from - https://medium.com/@erayerdin/send-sms-with-python-eab7a5854d3a

This allows you to send SMS from your phone using Airmore (www.airmore.com) utility and the OpenPyxl.
You can find the docs for both here as well - 
https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#read-an-existing-workbook
https://pyairmore.readthedocs.io/en/master/ 

Of course based on your need you can customize the script to run for some specific conditions as well.

Run the following commands to install the pyAirmore and openpyxl

pip install pyairmore
pip install openpyxl
