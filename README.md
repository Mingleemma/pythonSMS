# Script to automate sending SMS #
A simple SMS gateway based off [@erayedin Github Gist Code](https://gist.github.com/erayerdin "Named link title")

You can find the tutorial used on [Medium](https://medium.com/@erayerdin/send-sms-with-python-eab7a5854d3a "Named link title")

This allows you to send SMS from your phone using Airmore utility and the OpenPyxl.
You can find the docs for both here as well

https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#read-an-existing-workbook

https://pyairmore.readthedocs.io/en/master/ 

Of course based on your need you can customize the script to run for some specific conditions as well.

Run the following commands 

Install the pyAirmore

`pip install pyairmore`

Install openpyxl

`pip install openpyxl`

Run the file

`python main.py`
